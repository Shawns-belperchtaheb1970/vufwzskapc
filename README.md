Oh man, I just finished watching Antes del cuerpo and I don’t even know where to start. It’s like, what did I even watch, you know what I mean? One moment I’m like “wow that’s deep” and the next I’m scratching my head like some clueless kid. Seriously, who even comes up with this stuff?

I swear, the cinematography was on point tho. The colors hit just right and made me feel like I was falling into the screen or something. The storyline though — like, huh?? I’m all for artsy films but sometimes you just wanna scream at the screen, “come on, give me something to work with!”

> Have you seen that bit where the dude just stands there, staring into the abyss or whatever? Like, do something, dude! And don't even get me started on the dialogue, it was all poetic and mysterious but left me wanting to download the movie again just to catch whatever I missed. Maybe I’m just too tired to fully get it, lol.

Anyway, I had to watch the movie twice cuz I definitely didn’t get everything the first time. It’s like trying to put together a puzzle with missing pieces! But oh my gosh, the soundtrack was amazing. I might just playlist that to death.

Imagine having to explain this movie to someone. I would look like an idiot. “Well, you see, it’s about… uhm, bodies? And some existential stuff or whatever.” Like, what even is life!? I felt like the movie was half in Spanish and half in some space alien language I would never understand.

Console.WriteLine(I bet you can’t even spell existential crisis at 3 AM.);

Oh crap, I just noticed the time, I’m gonna crash so hard. Let’s just say this movie was a trip and a half, and maybe it’s one of those that make more sense in your dreams or after a whole pot of coffee. Whatever, I need sleep. Peace out! 🚀
